Hello Professor. I ran the game in WinFrotz and I noticed that there is a WinFrotz error where as soon as the text scrolls down the screen, messages stop displaying. I don't know why. The game runs fine in the Inform7 IDE. And I released it as a .z file using the Inform7's release option. Not sure why WinFrotz is breaking though. I hope you don't encounter this strange problem when running it on your WinFrotz.
