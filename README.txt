Hello Professor. I ran the game in WinFrotz and I noticed that there is a WinFrotz error / glitch in which the game messages don't displayed correctly if the WinFrotz window is too small. 
I restarted WinFrotz the application and resized the screen and everything worked properly when I re-ran the game. I just wanted to give you a heads up about that because the error made it so that key information wasn't displaying to the user.
